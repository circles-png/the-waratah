The Buggaroo Bureau of Statistics (BBoS) released a report on electric vehicles in Australia last Monday. It showed that the cars are constantly stopping in the middle of traffic due to empty batteries.

text
"One in four electric vehicles have a 100% chance of running out of battery at some point in their lifetime," the report stated. "And one in four of those do run out of battery, taking into account the other four that won't."

text
This should only happen out of an owner's ignorance towards their car's battery status. However, the report shows that more than 88% of the cars that run out of battery are less than a week old.

text
One such case happened on the Brand Highway to 49-year-old Anthony Driver, a new Tesla owner.

text
"Yeah mate, it was brand new, straight out of the shop. I was on my way back home down the highway, and I was quite liking it. Pretty well silent, and this big fancy screen in it."

text
But it was at this point that disaster struck.

text
"The damn thing just stopped. In the middle of the road. Caused a good pile up, I did," Mr Driver recounted.

Anthony Driver's sudden Tesla stops causes a dangerous pile up.

text
But why did his car suddenly stop? According to Mr Driver, it "turns out the dealers only charged it to nearly twelve percent."

text
The BBoS's report claims that "Of the one in four independent dealers who won't fully charge an EV, one in four of them sometimes won't, and the other four never will."

text
This is due to the fact that electricity prices have been rocketing, and as demand for EVs drops dealers are trying to lower their electricity bills.

text
This attitude raises the question: is it worth buying cars from slack dealers? In Anthony Driver's case, he decided it wasn't.

text
"Sent the Tesla to the wrecker. Now I'm off to buy a good old Land Rover that won't suddenly stop on me."
