The Dongara Bureau of Statistics released a report on electric vehicles in Australia last Monday. It showed that the cars are constantly stopping in the middle of traffic due to empty batteries.

text
"One in four electric vehicles have a 100% chance of running out of battery at some point in their lifetime," the report stated. "And one in four of those do run out of battery, taking into account the other four that won't."

One such case happened on the Brand Highway to 49-year-old Anthony Tailor, a new Tesla owner.

text
"It was brand new, straight out of the shop. I was on my way back home down the highway, and I was quite liking it. Pretty well silent, and this big fancy screen in it."

But it was at this point that disaster struck.

text
"The damn thing just stopped. In the middle of the road. Caused a good pile up, I did," Mr Tailor recounted. "Turns out the dealers only charged it to nearly twelve percent."
