The self-centered chickens at Warrah Poultry Outlet deciding on strike terms.
text
Last Monday, chickens at Warrah Poultry Farm decided to indefinitely stop working due to labour conditions. After negotiating the situation with the 49-year-old farmer Peter Farmer, the two parties were unable to come to an agreement and so the former decided to launch a strike.

text
For Mr Farmer, this came as a nasty surprise emotionally.

text
"I never thought that it would come to this. Me and the chooks always had a healthy relationship, and this is really quite a mental shock," he told The Warrah Recliner.

text
When asked about the situation, the chickens were not available for comment, and quite close-mouthed about the matter.

text
Economically, Peter Farmer had expected a yield of 3,300 eggs from the chickens, but received only 1 from one particularly nice chicken named Hennifer Aniston. And this didn't just affect him, but also the rest of the local community.

text
"Basically everyone in Warrah buys my eggs, and now I've had to raise the cost just a tad."

text
While eggs had previously cost a dollar each, the price jumped up by was $3,300 for the one egg in stock. It was finally sold to a schoolboy named Charlie for his school's lunch making challenge.

Can the chickens be expected to return to work any time soon? According to Mr Farmer, it's not likely.

text
"Me and the chooks have fallen out big time. Some of them are even talking about leaving the farm for good."

text
Mr Farmer has decided he'll have to buy some new chickens to replace the old ones, otherwise Warrah's egg supply would be critically low.

text
"I was talking with Hennifer and she has some cousins living in the big smoke who said they'd come and work here. I'll have to pay 'em a fair bit though, but it should be worth it. I mean, unless anyone else wants a 3300 dollar egg?"
