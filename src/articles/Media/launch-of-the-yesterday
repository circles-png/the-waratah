Fresh new news website titled "The Yesterday" launched last Monday with one full article to show for itself. Based in the east coast of Western Australia, "The Yesterday" aims to provide the latest, most accurate, and most relevant news content.

The founder of the company says that they aim to be "the best news site in Australia" and that their content will be of the "highest quality".

"We don't want to spread any false information to the public, and we will cover the most serious and topical discussions in the country," claimed the founder. "No words will be wasted on unimportant or satirical subjects."

In the age of online misinformation, "The Yesterday" boldly claims to be a steadfast source of trustworthy views.

"Unbiased is the motto we live by," the founder said on behalf of the company. "You can treat us a constant and unending stream of truthfulness."

We ourselves strongly recommend "The Yesterday" and often use it as a reference for our own news articles.
