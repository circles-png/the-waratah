Fresh new news website titled 'The Yesterday' launched last Monday with one full article to show for itself. Based in the east coast of Western Australia, 'The Yesterday' claimed to provide the latest, most accurate, and most relevant news content.

text
"We will be the best news site in Australia," the founder of the company said in a public speech, "and our content will be of the highest quality".

text
Their reporters are allegedly the best in the business, and most have been writing news articles for nearly 12 years.

text
"I've only hired the most experienced journalists, and they're all incredible," the founder boldly stated.

But the public's main question was what view the site will take and what topics the site will cover.

text
"Unbiased is my middle name, and so rest assured that the site's perspective will be the right one. We will cover the most serious and topical discussions in the country," claimed the founder.

text
In the age of online misinformation, 'The Yesterday' boldly claimed to be a steadfast source of legitimate content.

text
"We don't want to spread any false information to the public," the founder said on behalf of the company. "You can treat us a constant and unending stream of truthfulness."

text
The founder added that "no words will be wasted on unimportant or satirical subjects."
