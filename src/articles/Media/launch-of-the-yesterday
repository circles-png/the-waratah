"We will be the best news site in Australia," the 49-year-old founder of the company said in a public speech, "and our content will be of the highest quality."

But the public's main question was what view the site will take and what topics the site will cover.

"Unbiased is my middle name, and so rest assured that the site's perspective will be the right one. We will cover the most serious and topical discussions in the country," claimed the founder.

In the age of online misinformation, 'The Yesterday' boldly claimed to be a steadfast source of legitimate content.

text
"We don't want to spread any false information to the public," the founder said on behalf of the company. "You can treat us as a constant and unending stream of truthfulness."

The founder added that "no words will be wasted on unimportant or satirical subjects."
