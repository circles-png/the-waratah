The previously printed local newspaper of Buggaroo, a small seaside town on Dongara's east coast, established an online website last Monday. 'The Yesterday', named after the original physical newspaper, claimed to provide the latest, most accurate, and most relevant news content about the daily going-ons at Buggaroo.

"We will be the best news site in Australia," Mr Mason, the founder of 'The Yesterday', said in a public speech, "and our content will be of the highest quality."

Their reporters are allegedly the best in the state, and combined have nearly 12 years of experience in journalism.

text
"I've only hired the most experienced journalists, and they're all incredible," the founder boldly stated.

text
But the public's main questions were about what view the site would take and what topics it would cover.

text
"Honest is my middle name, and so rest assured that the site will provide the most truthful and factual perspective. We will cover the current topical events in Buggaroo and the most serious discussions in the country," claimed the site's publisher, Mr Deis Lee.

In the age of online misinformation, 'The Yesterday' boldly professed to be a steadfast source of legitimate content.

text
"We don't want to spread any false information to the public," the Mr Mason said on behalf of the company. "You can treat us as a constant and unending stream of truthfulness."

The founder added that "no words will be wasted on unimportant or satirical subjects."
