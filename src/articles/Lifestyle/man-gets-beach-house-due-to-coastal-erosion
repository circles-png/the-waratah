Mitchell Smith, owner of a local plumbing business in Buggaroo, woke up last Monday morning to find the ocean literally at his doorstep.

text
"Yeah mate, it was great. I mean I'm not sure how long it'll last, but while it does it's quite nice."

text
Mr Smith's house was originally one of the furthest from the shoreline in the small coastal town, but due to recent coastal erosion, it is now the closest - only a couple metres from the sand.

text
Authorities say that this could be a temporary situation, and that the house may be at risk of falling into the ocean in the near future. However, Mr Smith is not worried.

text
"He'll have to move out in a couple days. The clay and bedrock underneath the house is eroding away, and it's only a matter of time before it collapses." said a local geologist.

text
Experts say that the erosion is caused by extreme weather events in the area, and that it is likely to continue in the future. An estimated 49 homes in the area are at risk of being lost to the ocean in the next 10 years.

Despite the risks, Mr Smith is happy with his new beachfront property. "I've always wanted to live by the beach, and now I do. It's a dream come true."
