Mitchell Plumber, 49-year-old owner of a local plumbing business in Buggaroo, woke up last Monday morning to find the ocean literally at his doorstep.

text
"Yeah mate, it's great. I mean I'm not sure how long it'll last, but while it does it's quite nice."

text
Mr Plumber's house was originally one of the furthest from the shoreline in the small coastal town, but due to recent coastal erosion, it is now the closest - only a couple metres from the surf. And to Mitchell Plumber, this comes with certain perks.

text
"With the sea so close, I don't even have to use my own toilet anymore. Which is good, because it hardly works."

text
His house has now gone up in value by a whopping $2.4M, making him one of the wealthiest and luckiest land-owners in Buggaroo.

"I had all the rellies over last week for a barbie and an afternoon swim in the surf."

Mitchell Plumber's house's value increase since the coastline retreat.

Unfortunately, Mr Plumber was right to wonder about the definiteness of the situation.

text
"He'll have to move out in a couple of weeks. The clay and bedrock underneath the house is eroding away, and it's only a matter of time before it collapses." said a local geologist. "And not only that, but his house will become practically worthless."

text
Experts say that the erosion is caused by extreme weather events in the area, and that it is likely to continue in the future. According the the Buggaroo Bureau of Statistics, an estimated one in four homes in the area are at risk of having a one in four chance of being lost to the ocean in at least one of the next four years, if not four of the other one.

Despite the risks, Mr Plumber is happy with his new beachfront property. "I've always wanted to live right by the beach, and now I do. It's a dream come true."
