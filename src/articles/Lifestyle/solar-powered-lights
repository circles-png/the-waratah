Last Monday, Australian inventor James Sherman, posted about his latest creation: a highly affordable solar-powered lighting system called EcoGlow. Mr Sherman says that EcoGlow is designed to give off a warm and natural light, and that it's even a source of Vitamin D. 

text
"We're saving over 88% on our electricity bills," said one satisfied customer. "It's a real game-changer." 

text
The best part is, EcoGlow can be installed in a matter of minutes.

"We just bring a skip bin and the guys with the wrecking ball," the 49-year-old creator said, "and the job's over in less than half an hour." Mr Sherman himself oversees all installations of his invention.

The revolutionary solar-powered lighting system, EcoGlow, in action.

EcoGlow has been praised by environmentalists and homeowners alike. Reported efficiency rates are as high as 100%, and the light is as bright as the sun all day long, which is when you most need it.

text
"It's clean, efficient, and affordable, and it's changed the way we think about lighting," reported one reputable architect. "Rest assured that all houses in the future will use EcoGlow."

Upfront costs are cheap as a handsaw, but there are extra options available. EcoGlow Max is the extended version, and EcoGlow To Go is the portable version. Both cost a fair bit more, but are highly recommended.

text
"I bought EcoGlow Max, and life's felt breezy ever since," stated another customer.

However the basic version is more than enough for most people.

"I designed EcoGlow to be environmentally friendly and affordable for all," Mr Sherman stated. "Just make sure you wear sunscreen."
