The fourth course of lunch made by a Year 4 student.

Last Monday, a challenge was given to the kids at Buggaroo Public School. The challenge was simple: make a lunch that is both healthy and delicious, with a budget of $5. But what the students managed to cook up was surprising.

text
Charlie, a Year 4 student, constructed a magnificent aromatic five-course meal. First, the appetiser, a delectable Spanish slice of Yubari melon draped with jamon Iberico de bellota, with a side of Almas caviar, from an albino Iranian beluga sturgeon.

text
The school's 49-year-old principal Thomas Principal described the appetiser as "exquisé́ et savoùreux: it was a dégoûtant of a dish."

Next was the starter, consisting of an eleven layer gourmet burger rivalling the work of professional chefs around the globe. With premium Wagyu beef and an authentic French lightly baked brioche bun, together with an exquisite wine, it came to about 75 cents of the $5 budget.

text
"I was gonna go for twelve layers, but I couldn't reach any higher so I had to stop at eleven," Charlie said.

text
The third course was a 30 carat gold flaked salad, a combination of exotic vegetables and seafood. Mr Principal said that "it was really good. Probably amongst the top fifty meals I tried that day."

text
Fourth, a main course of French trimmed lamb cutlets, lightly smoked and charred over African blackwood and sprinkled with dried saffron.

text
"A bit too burnt for my liking, but pretty good nonetheless," the principal stated, even though Charlie himself found it the "bestest" part of the meal.

text
Lastly, desert was an extremely lavish Parisian ice cream dessert with chocolate sauce, gold flakes, and caviar. The latter was a brave choice from Charlie.

text
"I don't really like fish but otherwise I was only using $4.60, so I just added the caviar to make the most of the budget."

text
This was only one of the 600 lunches made that day. And according to Charlie, his was one of the "worstest" there.
