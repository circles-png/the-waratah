Robert Fuller, an expert in war, shared horrifying new finds from his latest study last Monday. Located on the east coast of Dongara, Mr Fuller has nearly 12 years of experience in his field, and he's nearly finished writing a scholarly paper.

text
His study released new evidence about the different causes of death in war and the percentages of deaths that each cause causes.

text
"More than 100% of deaths in armed conflicts are caused by arms and conflicts," the 49-year-old reported.

text
"The main sources of fatalities, and casualties, but that's another topic, are kinetic projectiles. This category mainly consists of bullets, particularly from machine guns."

But these frightening facts have a bright side. Mr Fuller believes that he has found a way to greatly reduce the number of fatalities in war.

text
"If weapons are the greatest reason for deaths in armed conflicts, then simply removing the weapons would result in only 1% the amount of deaths," Mr Fuller reasoned. "I propose that all countries adopt a 'No Arms' policy."

text
Some countries have already agreed to this policy, but others are more skeptical.

text
"How are we meant to die in war with no weapons? You are meant to die for your country in war, a war is meant for dying!" proclaimed one national leader.

text
Others disagreed. The Yesterday believes this to be due to a miscommunication.

text
"We will not amputate our soldiers," one politician said.

text
But Robert Fuller's extensive research is extremely conclusive, and he is slowly but surely working towards getting his policy recognised and employed internationally. However, no further updates are available thus far.
