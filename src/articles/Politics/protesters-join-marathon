Protesters winning the marathon
text
Last Monday, a group of protesters in the town centre of Warrah accidentally joined a charity marathon.

The public outcry was initially met with confusion, as the protesters merged with the runners and began to overtake them.

In the end, one lucky protester miraculously won the marathon, despite not having registered for the event and also joining five hundred metres before the finish line. The protester was promptly disqualified.

It was unclear what the protesters were demonstrating against - they were carrying banners and chanting slogans which all seemed to disagree.
