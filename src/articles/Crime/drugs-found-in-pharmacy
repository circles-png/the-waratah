Last Monday, police responded to local concerns by raiding a local pharmacy on the east coast of Dongara Senior Sergeant Carpenter, the officer in charge of the case, stated that "shelves full of drugs", which the owner claimed were medicinal, were found in the pharmacy's storeroom.

text
"We were alerted by locals who had seen people exiting the building with suspicious looking substances in suspicious looking paper bags," said the Senior Sergeant as he addressed the public.

text
The region's police unit decided to put Senior Sergeant Carpenter in charge of the case because of his background in the Illicit Drug Inspection and Observation Team. And sure enough, he was able to find the cleverly camouflaged substances.

text
"The drugs were in all sorts of forms: pills, liquid, tablets, even needles," said Senior Sergeant Carpenter. "Many were disguised under names of popular medicinal brands."

text
Sergeant Carpenter kindly decided to show The Yesterday an example of such a case. "Here you can see the drug paracetemol in a box labelled 'Panadol'. A clear case of illegal mislabelling and concealment."

text
But the pharmacy's owner, 49-year-old John Turner, declined to acknowledge illegality of the substances.

text
"They aren't ****** illegal drugs," declared Mr Turner. "They're just ****** pharmaceutical. These cops are ****** idiots."

text
"We are yet to discover just how much Mr Turner has been making off the sales of these substances," Senior Sergeant Carpenter continued, "as he is stubbornly refusing to answer our questions. However, our estimation is 1-2 million Australian dollars."

text
Police decided to undertake disciplinary action against Mr Turner, and he is currently being held in custody. However, things could get more serious.

text
"The matter could be taken to court, and I believe that Mr Turner will be jailed for a very long time," announced the Senior Sergeant. "This is a serious case of hiding illegal substances and non-cooperation with police officers."

text
The pharmacy has been closed indefinitely, and no further information has been released to the public.
