Camouflage has developed greatly over the years, used for concealing military personnel, inspired by animals such as chameleons and octopuses. The Australian Army has been testing out a new camouflage uniform, which has been reported to be so effective that last Monday, the soldiers wearing it have gone missing.

"They were just getting ready for a training exercise, and then they just disappeared," said a spokesperson for the Australian Army. "We're not sure where they are, but we're confident that they're still on the base." Reportedly, during the interview, a small sample was presented (our interviewer was unable to see it).

Efforts to locate the missing soldiers have so far been unsuccessful, and "it's like they've just vanished". They were not equipped with any tracking devices as a result of inadequate planning.

However, at the Australian Army base, possibly related to the incident, there have been reports of disappearances of items such as food, equipment, and even vehicles. The Australian Army has not yet commented on the matter.
