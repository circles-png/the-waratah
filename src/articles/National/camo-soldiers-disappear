The Australian Army was recently testing out a new camouflage uniform at its small base Buggaroo Barracks, located in Buggaroo off the east coast of the Mid West Region of WA. The camo was reported to have been so effective that last Monday the soldiers wearing it went missing.

text
Man-made camouflage, first inspired by animals like chameleons and octopuses, has developed greatly over the years for the specific purpose of concealing military personnel and equipment.

text
Buggaroo Barracks has been Australia's leading authority in bush camouflage for nearly 12 years.

text
"Yeah mate, we're pretty much the best in the world at the job. And this was a completely new design for the standard Australian camo," said 49-year-old Major General Andrew Cook, Head of Tactical Concealment at Buggaroo Barracks.

Our reporter was lucky enough to be presented with a small sample of the new fabric during the interview, although they were unable to see it. A picture is included below.

"It utilises a slightly different pattern deemed to be 1.92% more effective at concealment," the Major General continued.

text
However after testing it in the field, Major General Cook's research results were proved to be very wrong.

text
"They were getting ready for a training exercise in the new uniform, and then they just disappeared," the Major General replied in answer to a question about the missing soldiers. "We're not sure where they are, but we're confident that they're somewhere on the base."

The Tactical Concealment deparment's consecutive research showed that the camo was, in fact, 1920.0% more effective.

text
Efforts to locate the missing soldiers have so far been unsuccessful, as "it's like they're invisible". Unfortunately, the soldiers were not equipped with any tracking devices as a result of inadequate planning.

text
As an unrelated sidenote, there have been reports of disappearances of equipment and vehicles at Buggaroo Barracks. The Australian Army has not yet commented on the matter.
