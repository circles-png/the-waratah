An unidentified household refrigerator was seen running down Brand Highway outside Buggaroo last Monday. Law enforcement, led by Senior Sergeant Carpenter, began searching for the refrigerator as soon as it was reported missing.

text
The owner of the refrigerator, who wishes to remain anonymous, received a call from a neighbor who saw the refrigerator escaping from the house.

text
"I was on vacation when I got that call, and I thought it was those damn pranksters again," said the 49-year-old owner. "They said 'Is your refrigerator running?' and I hung up on them. And now it's all over the damn news."

text
The refrigerator was last seen on Brand Highway near the port, where it was captured on CCTV cameras. The footage shows the refrigerator running away from the house, with a trail of food scraps and condensation left behind.

"The strange thing is, my refrigerator doesn't usually run," the owner continued. "Usually the damn thing just makes whirring noises and I have to keep all the cold foods in the pantry."

text
Unfortunately the owner had not taken such precautions on the day in question.

text
"That day it was running pretty well so I put half my damn food back in, and now it's all gone," he complained.

The refrigerator is described as white or of European origin, with a height of about two metres, and as having a freezer unit on top. It was last seen wearing a porcelain coat, with a few dents on the side. A sketch of the refrigerator has been released to the public, shown below.

It is still unclear why the refrigerator started running from its owner's home, but police are thoroughly investigating the incident.

text
The area's inhabitants have been told to be on the lookout for the refrigerator, and any information on the refrigerator's whereabouts should be reported to the local police department. And although the refrigerator is not considered dangerous, residents have been advised to keep their distance upon sighting.

text
It is unlikely that the refrigerator will be detained for any reason besides interrogation, and the owner of the refrigerator has offered a cash reward for any information leading to the recovery of the refrigerator.
