Last Monday, police responded to local concerns by raiding a local pharmacy on the east coast of WA. Constable Thatcher stated that "shelves full of drugs", which the owner claims to know nothing about, were found in the pharmacy's storeroom.

text
"The drugs were in all sorts of forms: pills, liquid, tablets, even needles," says Senior Sergeant Carpenter. "Many were disguised under names of popular medicinal brands."

text
Police reports show that the drug paracetemol was in a box inappropriately labelled 'Panadol'.

text
"We are yet to discover just how much the pharmacy's owner has been making off the sales of these substances," Senior Sergeant Carpenter continues, "as he is making things tricky for us."

text
"I knew nothing of the existence of these drugs," declares 49-year-old owner John Turner.

text
Police decided to undertake disciplinary action against Mr Turner, and he is currently being held in custody. The drugs are being tested to determine their contents.

text
The pharmacy has been closed for the time being, and no further information has been released to the public.
