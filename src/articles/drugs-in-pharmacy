Storeroom of pharmacy in question.

Last Monday, police responded to local concerns by raiding a local pharmacy on the east coast of WA. Constable Thatcher stated that "shelves full of drugs", which the owner claimed were medicinal, were found in the pharmacy's storeroom.

text
"The drugs were in all sorts of forms: pills, liquid, tablets, even needles," said Senior Sergeant Carpenter. "Many were disguised under names of popular medicinal brands."

text
Police reports show that there were multiple cases of such misnomers, such as the drug paracetemol being in a box inappropriately labelled 'Panadol'.

text
"These aren't illegal drugs," declared 49-year-old owner John Turner. "They're just pharmaceutical substances."

text
"We are yet to discover just how much the pharmacy's owner has been making off the sales of these substances," Senior Sergeant Carpenter continued, "as he is making things tricky for us. However our estimation is 1-2 million Australian dollars."

text
Police decided to undertake disciplinary action against Mr Turner, and he is currently being held in custody. The drugs have been tested by the police force's Illicit Drug Inspection and Observation Team and have been found to be strictly illegal.

text
"Mr Turner will be jailed for a very long time," announced the Senior Sergeant. "This is a serious case of hiding illegal substances and lying to police officers."

text
The pharmacy has been closed indefinitely, and no further information has been released to the public.
